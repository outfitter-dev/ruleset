# 📏 Rulesets: A Compiler for AI Rules Files

> **🚀 v0 Release Now Available!** The initial implementation of Rulesets is ready for testing. See [Installation](#installation) to get started.

Rulesets simplifies rules management for tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc. With Rulesets, you author rules (called "source rules") in previewable Markdown and compile them into compiled rules for each destination (`.cursor/rules.mdc`, `./CLAUDE.md`, `.roo/rules.md`, and more). Think of it as **Terraform for AI rules**: write once, compile for many destinations, your agents, no matter the tool, on the (literal) same page.

## What is Rulesets?

If you're reading this, you're probably already familiar with at least one of the AI coding tools that Rulesets is [designed to work with](#supported-destinations). Each tool has its own unique way of being provided context, guidance, and operational instructions for your projects e.g. Cursor's rules (`.cursor/rules`), OpenAI Codex instructions (`codex.md`), Claude Code's instructions (`CLAUDE.md`), etc.

The problem is, they all have different formats, behavior, and capabilities, which can become a huge pain to manage. This can be frustrating, and might even lead you to just sticking to one tool. But that's no fun, and you'll be missing out on all the awesome capabilities and differences each tool has to offer! That's where Rulesets comes in…

### The Problem Rulesets Solves

- Agentic rules files are **fragmented** across IDEs and agentic tools, following different formats, and in disparate locations, leading to duplication and drift.
- Manual copy-paste workflows break **source-of-truth** guarantees and slow (or halt) experimentation with new agentic tools (that might even be better suited for the task).
- Lack of a **cohesive format for rules** hinders creation, testing, versioning, and overall management.

### Our Solution: What Rulesets Does

Rulesets is "Terraform for AI rules": declare your ideal rules once, compile for dozens of coding agents, and guarantee every teammate (human or bot) runs with the same authoritative rules—no copy‑paste, no drift, just high‑quality, version-controlled context.

With Rulesets, you can apply the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle to your agentic coding tools. Instead of writing slightly different versions of the same instructions for each tool, you create a single source rules file (`.mix.md`). This source rules file is the "gold master" for your instructions, from which individual compiled rules are created for each destination and sent to the right places.

The app consists of:

1. A Node.js app with a compiler (featuring a plugin architecture for different tools), an API, CLI, and Model Context Protocol implementation for managing prompts and instructions.
2. A CommonMark-compliant markup specification for creating effective and reusable rules, processed by the compiler to generate destination-specific rules files.

Result: *author once, distribute everywhere, zero drift.*

## What's with the name?

We chose "Rulesets" because it captures the essence of what this tool does: organizing and compiling rule collections for AI assistants. The project was originally inspired by the music production concept of "mixdown" - the process where multiple audio tracks are combined into a final master recording. Similarly, Rulesets takes your various rule definitions and compiles them into the perfect format for each destination tool like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and beyond.

## Core Concepts

**source rules**
: source rules files, written in 100% previewable Markdown with `.rules.md` extension. Written in Rulesets notation and use `{{...}}` notation markers to direct the compiler.

**compiled rules**
: Destination-specific compiled files (e.g., `.cursor/rules/foo.mdc`, `./CLAUDE.md#project-conventions`). When placed in their destination directories, these are referred to as "tool-ready rules".

**Stem**
: Delimited, reusable blocks of content using notation like `{{instructions}}...{{/instructions}}` with optional properties. They are 1:1 translations of XML tags (e.g., `{{instructions}}` → `<instructions>`), but readable in Markdown previewers.

**Import**
: A reference to another source rules file, stem, mixin, or template (`{{> my-rule}}`). Embeds content from another source.

**Variable**
: Dynamic value replaced inline at compile time (e.g., `{{$key}}` for aliases, `{{$.frontmatter.key}}` for frontmatter data, `{{$destination}}` for the current destination name).

**Notation Marker**
: Element using `{{...}}` notation, used throughout Mixdown to direct the compiler. Similar to `<xml-tags>`, but fully Markdown-previewable.

**Mixin**
: Modular, reusable content component stored in `/_mixins`.

**Destination**
: A supported tool (Cursor, Roo Code, etc.) identified by a `kebab-case` ID (e.g., `cursor`, `roo-code`). Defines destination-specific criteria for compiling source rules into compiled rules and is provided through plugins.

**Destination Group**
: Named set of destinations (`@cursor`, `@ide`, `@cli`) for property filtering (a planned feature for easier filtering).

*Want a new destination? Implement `toolProvider` and publish `@mixdown/plugin-<your-tool>`. See existing plugin examples and general development guidelines.*

## Key Features

### Mixdown Notation

- **100% Preview-able Markdown** – Renders cleanly in GitHub, VS Code, etc.; passes markdown-lint.
- **Granular Stems** – Filter stems within a single source rules file for per-destination inclusion/exclusion.
- **Build-time Variables** – Aliases and frontmatter data injection.

### Compiler & Integration

- **Plugin Architecture** – Add new destinations via `RulesetsPluginProvider` without touching core.
- **CLI & API** – `rulesets build`, `rulesets validate`, and `POST /compile` endpoint.

## CLI Installation

```bash
npm install -g @rulesets/cli        # global CLI
npx @rulesets/cli init              # quick project bootstrap
```

## Library Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @rulesets/core

# Using Bun (recommended)
bun add @rulesets/core

# Using yarn
yarn add @rulesets/core
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a source rules file (`my-rules.rules.md`)

```markdown
---
rulesets: { version: "0.1.0" }
title: My Coding Standards
description: Rules for AI coding assistants
destinations:
  cursor:
    outputPath: ".cursor/rules/standards.mdc"
  windsurf:
    outputPath: ".windsurf/rules/standards.md"
---

# Coding Standards

Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
Prefer functional programming patterns.
Write comprehensive tests for all features.
```

### 2. Use the API to process your rules

```typescript
import { runRulesetsV0, ConsoleLogger } from '@rulesets/core';

async function main() {
  const logger = new ConsoleLogger();
  
  try {
    await runRulesetsV0('./my-rules.rules.md', logger);
    console.log('Rules compiled successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

### 3. Find your compiled rules at:
- `.cursor/rules/standards.mdc` (for Cursor)
- `.windsurf/rules/standards.md` (for Windsurf)

## V0 Limitations

The current v0 release provides foundational functionality:

- ✅ Frontmatter parsing and validation
- ✅ Basic file compilation and writing
- ✅ Destination plugin architecture
- ❌ Mixdown notation markers (`{{...}}`) are not processed (passed through as-is)
- ❌ No stem/import/variable support yet

These advanced features are planned for v0.x releases leading to v1.0.
