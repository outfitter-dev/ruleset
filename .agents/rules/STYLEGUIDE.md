# Styleguide

## Language Guide

### General Principles

- Prefer clear, specific terminology over vague descriptions
- Be consistent with capitalization and hyphenation
- Use declarative present tense when describing functionality

### Project Naming Conventions

- Use "Ruleset" (uppercase) for the project name
- Use "ruleset" (lowercase) in most other cases, such as the name of a project's ruleset directory
- Use "rulesets" (lowercase) for a plural form of "ruleset"

### Other Naming Conventions

- Use "front matter" for the YAML section at the beginning of a file

## Migration Guide

- This project was previously called "Mixdown" and we need to migrate to the new name "Ruleset"
- This may require updating all documentation and code to use the new name
- Any mention of `mixd` should be carefully reviewed and updated accordingly
