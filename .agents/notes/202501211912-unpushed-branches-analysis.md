# Unpushed Branches Analysis

**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Purpose:** Document analysis of local branches with unpushed commits to determine if valuable work needs preservation

## Executive Summary

Analyzed 6 local branches that appeared to have unpushed commits. Found that all valuable work is already preserved in remote branches, except for one WIP template caching experiment that should be kept for future review.

## Branches Analyzed

### 6. feature/consolidate-all-prs (4 commits ahead, ~~DELETED FROM REMOTE~~ PUSHED TO REMOTE 2025-01-21)

**Commits:**

- `1dd85aa` WIP: Save state before reset
- `be1b01a` Merge branch 'release/v0.1-beta' into feature/handlebars-template-caching
- `90ad986` feat(core): add enhanced parallel processing support to release branch
- `6d3975b` feat(compiler): implement template caching for Handlebars compilation

**Status:** ✅ Pushed to remote on 2025-01-21 for preservation

- 1,376 lines of template caching work
- Marked as "WIP: Save state before reset"
- Experimental work that was preserved to `origin/feature/consolidate-all-prs`
- Contains TypeScript compatibility issue with Object.hasOwn that needs fixing

## Key Findings

1. **No data loss risk:** All production-ready commits are already safe in remote branches
2. **Remote preservation:** Most valuable work exists in `origin/release/v0.1-beta`
3. **WIP branch retained:** `feature/consolidate-all-prs` kept for future analysis of template caching experiment

## Recommendations for Future Agents

1. **Review WIP template caching:** The `feature/consolidate-all-prs` branch contains substantial template caching implementation that may be valuable:
   - File: `packages/core/src/compiler/__tests__/template-caching.test.ts` (310 lines)
   - File: `packages/core/src/compiler/handlebars-compiler.ts` (238+ lines modified)
   - File: `packages/core/src/index.ts` (745+ lines added)

2. **Safe to clean:** The following local branches can be deleted as their commits exist in remotes:
   - `release/v1.0`
   - `feat/ci-and-config-improvements`
   - `feature/complete-music-terminology-removal`
   - `feature/handlebars-adoption`
   - `release/v0.1-beta`

3. **Branch hygiene:** Consider establishing a regular cleanup process for local branches that have been merged or exist in remote branches.

## Commands for Reference

```bash
# Check which remote branches contain a specific commit
git branch -r --contains <commit-hash>

# Find branches with unpushed commits
git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)" refs/heads | grep ahead

# Check unpushed commits on a branch
git log --oneline origin/<branch>..<branch>

# Prune deleted remote branches
git fetch --prune
```
