# @rulesets/renderer

Renderer adapters for the Rulesets v0.4 pipeline. The current implementation is a passthrough renderer that keeps downstream packages compiling until Handlebars and Markdown renderers arrive.

## Scripts

- `bun run build`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run test`
